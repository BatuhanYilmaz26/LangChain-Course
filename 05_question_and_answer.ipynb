    "- Stuff method is really nice because its pretty simple. You just put all of it into one prompt and send that to the language model and get back one response. But that doesn't always work okay.\n",
    "- When we fetched the documents in the notebook, we only got 4 documents back and they were relatively small. But what if you wanted to do the same type of question answering over lots of different types of chunks? Then there are a few different methods that we can use.\n",
    "- The first is **\"Map_reduce\"**.\n",
    "  - This basically takes all the chunks, passes them along with the  question to a language model, gets back a response, and then uses another language model call to summarize all of the individual responses into a final answer.\n",
    "    - This is really powerful because it can operate over any number of documents.\n",
    "    - And it's also really powerful because you can do the individual questions in parallel.\n",
    "    - But it does take a lot more calls.\n",
    "    - And it does **treat all the documents as independent**, which may not always be the most desired thing.\n",
    "- Another method is **\"Refine\"**.\n",
    "  - This method is used to loop over many documents as well. But it actually does it iteratively.\n",
    "  - It builds upon the answer from the previous document. So this is really good for **combining information and building up an answer over time**.\n",
    "  - It will generally lead to longer answers.\n",
    "  - And it's also not as fast because now the calls aren't independent. They depend on the result of previous calls.\n",
    "  - This means that it often takes a good while longer and takes just as many calls as \"Map_reduce\", basically.\n",
    "- **\"Map_rerank\"** is a pretty interesting and a bit more experimental one where you do a single call to the language model for each document. And you also ask it to return a score. And then you select the highest score.\n",
    "  - This relies on the language model to know what the score should be. So you often have to tell it, \"Hey, it should be a high score if it's relevant to the document and really refine the instructions there.\n",
    "  - Similar to \"Map_reduce\", **all the calls are independent**. So you can batch them and it's relatively fast.\n",
    "  - But again, you're making a bunch of language model calls. So it will be a bit more expensive.\n",
    "- **The most common of these methods is the \"stuff method\"**, which we used in the notebook to combine it all into one document.\n",
    "- **The second most common is the \"Map_reduce\" method**, which takes these chunks and sends them to the language model.\n",
    "- These methods here can also be used for lots of other chains besides just question answering.\n",
    "  - For example a really common use case of the **\"Map_reduce\"** chain is for **summarization**, where you have a really long document and you want to recursively summarize pieces of information in it.\n",
